# DeltaZero

`DeltaZero` is a python implementation of the AlphaZero architecture for chess. Design ideas were
drawn from a couple of existing open-source python implementations, namely
[alpha-zero-general](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general) and
[chess-alpha-zero](https://github.com/Zeta36/chess-alpha-zero). My goal is to learn from these implementations,
and make readability/design improvements along the way.
